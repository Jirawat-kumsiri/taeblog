# SUMMARY
Larry McEnerney, University of Chicago Writing Program director, discusses effective academic writing, emphasizing reader-centric value over rule-based structure and focusing on creating knowledge valued by specific audiences.

# IDEAS
- Effective writing begins with understanding readers and their values rather than rules or personal insights.
- Writing is not for self-expression but for altering the ideas of specific audiences.
- Academic communities decide what counts as knowledge, emphasizing relevance over originality.
- Experts use writing to think, but effective writing must adapt for readers to grasp its value.
- Instability and contradiction often highlight the value of academic work to a community.
- Language creating tension, such as "however," "although," and "inconsistent," signals value to academic readers.
- Value lies in changing readers' views, not just adding information or filling knowledge gaps.
- Professional writing addresses reader needs, focusing on problems they find significant.
- Writers must identify and adhere to community-specific codes of language and structure.
- Reader perceptions, not content alone, determine the success of writing.
- Background and definitions often hinder, rather than enhance, value communication.
- Writing should focus on problems relevant to the target community, not personal interests.
- Clarity and organization are secondary to the perceived value by the audience.
- Interdisciplinary writing requires navigating multiple community expectations for success.
- Effective lit reviews enrich problems, showing instability or tension in prior work.
- Instability imposes costs or offers benefits, which should be clearly signaled in writing.
- Rule-driven academic writing often conflicts with professional expectations.
- Avoiding risk in academic writing often results in rejection due to lack of impact.
- Good writing strategies include embedding the problem in the readers’ community and using its terminology.
- Value in academic writing is created by identifying and addressing community doubts.
- “New” and “original” are less important than “valuable” for successful writing.
- Understanding audience doubts and preconceptions is key to creating persuasive arguments.
- Transition words like “but” and “although” are tools for framing value in arguments.
- Success in academic writing depends on adopting the rhetorical patterns of target journals.
- Readers prioritize relevance and the resolution of tensions over stylistic elements.
