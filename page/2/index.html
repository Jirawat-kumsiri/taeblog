</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="insights">Insights:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Testing after initial exposure transforms passive recognition into active recall.</li>
<li>Emotional engagement with material stimulates memory-forming neuromodulators.</li>
<li>High-quality sleep immediately after learning significantly consolidates memories.</li>

<h1 id="quotes">Quotes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Learning practices are not intuitive; much of what we believe is absolutely false.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Think of studying not to retain information, but to offset the natural forgetting process.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Testing oneself is the best tool to offset forgetting and lock information into memory.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Effort is the cornerstone of learning; challenges strengthen neural circuits.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Focus and attention are limited but renewable resources essential for studying.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Testing shows what you know and what you don&rsquo;t, a key to durable memory.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Most forgetting occurs without testing—one test can halve the forgetting rate.&rdquo;</li>
