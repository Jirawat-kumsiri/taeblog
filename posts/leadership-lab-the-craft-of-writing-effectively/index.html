Larry McEnerney, University of Chicago Writing Program director, discusses effective academic writing, emphasizing reader-centric value over rule-based structure and focusing on creating knowledge valued by specific audiences.

IDEAS

Effective writing begins with understanding readers and their values rather than rules or personal insights.
Writing is not for self-expression but for altering the ideas of specific audiences.
Academic communities decide what counts as knowledge, emphasizing relevance over originality.
Experts use writing to think, but effective writing must adapt for readers to grasp its value.
Instability and contradiction often highlight the value of academic work to a community.
Language creating tension, such as &ldquo;however,&rdquo; &ldquo;although,&rdquo; and &ldquo;inconsistent,&rdquo; signals value to academic readers.
Value lies in changing readers&rsquo; views, not just adding information or filling knowledge gaps.
Professional writing addresses reader needs, focusing on problems they find significant.
Writers must identify and adhere to community-specific codes of language and structure.
Reader perceptions, not content alone, determine the success of writing.
Background and definitions often hinder, rather than enhance, value communication.
Writing should focus on problems relevant to the target community, not personal interests.
Clarity and organization are secondary to the perceived value by the audience.
Interdisciplinary writing requires navigating multiple community expectations for success.
Effective lit reviews enrich problems, showing instability or tension in prior work.
Instability imposes costs or offers benefits, which should be clearly signaled in writing.
Rule-driven academic writing often conflicts with professional expectations.
Avoiding risk in academic writing often results in rejection due to lack of impact.
Good writing strategies include embedding the problem in the readers’ community and using its terminology.
Value in academic writing is created by identifying and addressing community doubts.
“New” and “original” are less important than “valuable” for successful writing.
Understanding audience doubts and preconceptions is key to creating persuasive arguments.
Transition words like “but” and “although” are tools for framing value in arguments.
Success in academic writing depends on adopting the rhetorical patterns of target journals.
Readers prioritize relevance and the resolution of tensions over stylistic elements.


INSIGHTS

Writing success depends on changing the ideas of readers, not communicating personal views.
Academic knowledge evolves through community consensus, not individual contributions.
Writers must identify and engage their audience&rsquo;s unique concerns and expectations.
Effective writing challenges existing ideas within the readers&rsquo; accepted frameworks.
Reader-centric value replaces the rule-based approach to writing.
Persuasion depends on addressing doubts unique to the reader community.
Effective lit reviews integrate problems, not just summaries of past work.
Instability, not continuity, drives reader engagement and value recognition.
Language codes in academic writing signal relevance and engagement within specific fields.
Professional writing balances the writer&rsquo;s thoughts with the reader&rsquo;s needs for clarity and impact.
